# Assignment 01: HTML and CSS2

In this assignment, you will modify the design of the cards we saw in week 1 to fit a historical project *of your own design.* That is, you will be imagining a historical project that can make use of the plaing card motif, and designing a single card that would fit well in that project. Your job is the following:

- think of a legitimate historical use for this "playing card" structure. You may want to represent a historical person, an event, or some kind of historical process. 
- Answer the questions in the file `Questions.md` using markdown syntax. 
- Fill in the HTML content for the example card by modifying `index.html`. You may want to add or change the underlying structure of the card to accommodate the data fields that your project would necessitate. Add **at least** one new class to any HTML element.
- Make *at minimum* the following CSS changes:
  - Change all the background colors to a color that is appropriate to your topic.
  - modify all the font family and font size settings
  - write a new CSS ruleset for the new class you have created.

As you work, commit your changes to git. When you are finished, simply push your changes to the `main` branch; I will see them and respond to your changes using GitHub's built-in PR comment functions. 

Good luck!
